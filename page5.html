                        <p1>The stretch between Malabar Hills to Dongri was historically the Isle of Bombay. Previously a hub of the British harbour due to its strategic positioning near the coast, this isle was gradually jeopardized by the early British rulers and their empires. </p1>
                        <p2> However, the Isle of Bombay currently houses many historic landmarks of the city such as the Banganga tank, Walakeshwar temple, the hanging garden, and other temples with intricate carvings.
