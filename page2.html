                        <p1>Located towards the North East of Worli, Mahim was under the rule of Raja Bhimdev in the 13th century, which then became the capital of the region. In the 14th century, Mahim was seized by the Sultanate of Gujarat. The Sultanate holds credit for the mosques and dargahs that are lined up in the region.</p1>
                        <p2> In the 19th century, it was connected by the Island of Salsette and the famous Mahim Causeway was built. The green-and-white domed Makhdoom Ali Mahimi shrine is one of the most famous mosques today. St. Michael’s Church and the ruins of the 17th-century Mahim Fort are also notable attractions of the region today.</p2>
