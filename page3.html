                        <p1>Mazagon derived from the name Matsya Gram or fishing village. It is located in the north to the eastern end of the isle of Bombay. Inhabited by the Portuguese fisherfolk before the 16th century, Mazagaon is one of the other harbour ports of the city</p1>
                        <p2>Mazagon still has traces of the initial Portuguese life here. It also houses certain hidden gems of the city such as the Chinese Temple, Our Lady of Rosery's Church and the Mausoleum of Mazagaon which has a striking resemblance to the Taj Mahal.</p2>
