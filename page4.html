                        <p1>Worli was an island that drew historic aficionados. The rich heritage fort was a highlight of this region. However, Worli is better known as the financial heart of the city today. The famous Worli-sea links and the skyline is the most scenic view of the city. People head to Worli just to witness the sea links and enjoy the sunsets at the Worli skyline. The view of the Arabian Sea from Worli is breathtaking.</p1>
