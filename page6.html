                        <p1>Before the Britishers invading this island in the 17th century, the Portuguese had named the island as Candil. However, Colaba means the territory of the Kolis, who are the native fishermen. In 1534 after the Treaty of Bassein, the island was acquired by the Portuguese and they controlled the island for almost a century from Goa. After the governance of the Britishers from 1672 to 1863, the island was declared as a separate municipal ward in the year 1872.</p1>
